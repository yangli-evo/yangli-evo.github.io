I am a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://prod.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/yang-li.html) at the University of Michigan. I am working with [Pro. Zhang](https://websites.umich.edu/~zhanglab/Research.html) to explore the mechanisms and processes underlying biological evolution using computational biology.

My broader interests include:
- **Genome Evolution and Phylogenetics**: Using large-scale genome data to explore molecular evolutionary relationships among species, phylogenetics, genome rearrangements, and genome duplications, and understanding how these factors influence species diversity and adaptation.
- **Fitness Landscapes**: Analyzing fitness landscapes to understand landscape navigability, high peaks accessibility, and evolutionary trajectories. This includes studying adaptive walks, epistasis, and how these factors influence the exploration of fitness landscapes and the achievement of high-fitness peaks.
- **[Horizontal Gene Transfer](pdf/Cell2022.pdf)**: Investigating how foreign genes enter and integrate into species' genomes, adapt within them, and shape the tree of life. This includes studying the mechanisms of gene acquisition, the impact on genomic diversity, and how these transfers influence evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships.

[Fruit flies exploit behavioral fever as a defense strategy against parasitic insects](pdf/SA2025.pdf)  **Science Advances** 2025 Sheng, Y., Xu, Z., **Yang Li**, Chen, J., Pang, L., Lu, Y., Dong, Z., Zhang, Q., Zhang, J., Feng, T.,
Shi, W., Wang, Y., Chen, X., Shen, X. & Huang, J. F

- Behavioral fever is observed in fruit flies infected by parasitoid wasps, marking the first documented case against macroparasites.
- The induction of behavioral fever depends on the upregulation of Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) genes; loss of Hsp70 abolishes fever, while overexpression triggers heat-seeking behavior.
- Elevated temperatures (behavioral fever) enhance host survival by killing parasitoid wasps through disrupting their gut microbiota via host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
- Behavioral fever strengthens host immune responses, notably upregulating AMP and other immune genes at higher temperatures.
- This adaptive strategy demonstrates how ectothermic animals leverage behavioral fever to combat macroparasite infections, expanding our understanding of host-parasite interactions.

[On the probability of reaching high peaks in fitness landscapes by adaptive walks](pdf/MBE2025.pdf)  **Molecular Biology and Evolution** 2025 **Yang Li** and Jianzhi Zhang

- The probability of reaching high peaks (P<sub>HP</sub>) varies widely across empirical and theoretical fitness landscapes.
- Landscape ruggedness strongly influences (P<sub>HP</sub>), with smoother landscapes allowing easier access to high peaks.
- Higher peaks generally have larger basins, but this correlation alone does not ensure high (P<sub>HP</sub>).
- Empirical landscapes do not consistently exhibit higher-than-expected (P<sub>HP</sub>) compared to RMF landscapes.

[Transcriptomic and proteomic effects of gene deletion are not evolutionarily conserved](pdf/GR2025.pdf)  **Genome Research** 2025 **Yang Li** and Jianzhi Zhang

- Gene knockout effects often include byproducts and do not reflect true function.

[How has HGT shaped the evolution of insect genomes?](pdf/EM.pdf)  **Environmental Microbiology** 2023 Chao, L., **Yang Li**, Chen, Y., Chen, X.-x., Huang, J., Rokas, A. Shen, X.-X.

- Insects are incredibly diverse and essential to ecosystems.
- Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is important in prokaryotic evolution, and recent studies show it also plays a role in insect evolution.
- Although genomic data has revealed many HGT events in insects, the full extent of its influence and the mechanisms behind it remain unclear.

- BmNPV infection changed the host endogenous hormone homeostasis.
- 20E and dopamine counteractively regulate ELA behavior induced by BmNPV.

[Identification of A functional region in Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus VP39 that is essential for nuclear actin polymerization](pdf/Virology2.pdf)  **Virology** 2020 Zhang, J., **Yang Li**, Zhao, S. Wu, X.

- Nuclear actin polymerization is crucial for the assembly of baculovirus nucleocapsid, but the virus-mediated mechanism remains unclear.
- VP39, the major protein in the baculovirus capsid, interacts with cellular actin and mediates actin polymerization. Its role in nuclear actin polymerization was previously uncertain.
- Deletion of vp39 abolished nuclear actin polymerization, which was restored upon vp39 repair, highlighting VP39's essential role in this process.
- Mutant analysis and intracellular localization studies identified that amino acids 192‚Äì286 in the C-terminal region of VP39 are crucial for nuclear actin polymerization.

[Dynamic chromatin accessibility profiling reveals changes in host genome organization in response to baculovirus infection](pdf/Plos.pdf)  **Plos Pathogens** 2020 Kong, X., Wei, G., Chen, N., Zhao, S., Shen, Y., Zhang, J., **Yang Li**, Zeng, X. Wu, X. 

- The study examines how Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection impacts host chromatin architecture.
- BmNPV infection leads to progressive chromatin remodeling, resulting in a more open chromatin structure and the marginalization of the host genome, accompanied by nucleosome disassembly.
- In uninfected cells, chromatin accessibility is regulated by euchromatic modifications, whereas BmNPV infection induces accessible regions associated with facultative heterochromatic modifications.
- The findings provide new insights into how DNA viruses alter host chromatin organization and epigenomic regulation.
