I am a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://prod.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/yang-li.html) at the University of Michigan. I am working with [Pro. Zhang](https://websites.umich.edu/~zhanglab/Research.html) to explore the mechanisms and processes underlying biological evolution using computational biology.

My broader interests include:
- **Genome Evolution and Phylogenetics**: Using large-scale genome data to explore molecular evolutionary relationships among species, phylogenetics, genome rearrangements, and genome duplications, and understanding how these factors influence species diversity and adaptation.
- **Fitness Landscapes**: Analyzing fitness landscapes to understand landscape navigability, high peaks accessibility, and evolutionary trajectories. This includes studying adaptive walks, epistasis, and how these factors influence the exploration of fitness landscapes and the achievement of high-fitness peaks.
- **[Horizontal Gene Transfer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.06.014)**: Investigating how foreign genes enter and integrate into species' genomes, adapt within them, and shape the tree of life. This includes studying the mechanisms of gene acquisition, the impact on genomic diversity, and how these transfers influence evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships.

- *Rotund* is differentially expressed between long-winged and short-winged BPHs.
- Knockdown of rotund reverses long wings into intermediate wings.
- Binding to the TF FoxO inhibits the rotund activity.

[How has HGT shaped the evolution of insect genomes?](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16311) **Environmental Microbiology** 2023 Chao Liu, **Yang Li** ec tl Xing-Xing Shen

- Insects are incredibly diverse and essential to ecosystems.
- Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is important in prokaryotic evolution, and recent studies show it also plays a role in insect evolution.
- Although genomic data has revealed many HGT events in insects, the full extent of its influence and the mechanisms behind it remain unclear.

[HGT is widespread in insects and contributes to male courtship in lepidopterans](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16311) **Cell** 2022 **Yang Li** ec tl Xing-Xing Shen

- Genome-scale screening of HGT in 218 insect genomes.
- Intron gains from native insect genomes were likely involved in HGT adaptation.
- Lepidopterans acquired, on average, the highest number of HGT-acquired genes.
- HGT-acquired gene enhances male courtship behavior in lepidopterans.

- BmNPV triggers the heat-shock response, resulting in severe brain pathology.
- BmNPV infection changed the host endogenous hormone homeostasis.
- 20E and dopamine counteractively regulate ELA behavior induced by BmNPV.
- Dopamine may promote dopaminergic signal systems to trigger this aberrant hyperactivity.

[Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus Bm46 is essential for efficient production of infectious BV and nucleocapsid morphogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198145) **Virus Research** 2023 **Yang Li** ec tl Xiaofeng Wu

- *Bm46* is not a core gene in baculovirus, but plays a pivotal role during the late infection.
- The deletion of Bm46 resulted in a decreased BV production but did not affect viral DNA replication.
- *Bm46* is required for the proper assembly and morphogenesis of nucleocapsid.
- In Bm46KO-infected cells, VP39 mislocalized into filaments and cables punctate in RZ.
