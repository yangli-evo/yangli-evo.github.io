I am a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://prod.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/postdoctoral-fellows/yang-li.html) at the University of Michigan. I am working with [Pro. Zhang](https://websites.umich.edu/~zhanglab/Research.html) to explore the mechanisms and processes underlying biological evolution using computational biology.

My broader interests include:
- **Genome Evolution and Phylogenetics**: Using large-scale genome data to explore molecular evolutionary relationships among species, phylogenetics, genome rearrangements, and genome duplications, and understanding how these factors influence species diversity and adaptation.
- **Fitness Landscapes**: Analyzing fitness landscapes to understand landscape navigability, high peaks accessibility, and evolutionary trajectories. This includes studying adaptive walks, epistasis, and how these factors influence the exploration of fitness landscapes and the achievement of high-fitness peaks.
- **[Horizontal Gene Transfer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.06.014)**: Investigating how foreign genes enter and integrate into species' genomes, adapt within them, and shape the tree of life. This includes studying the mechanisms of gene acquisition, the impact on genomic diversity, and how these transfers influence evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships.

#[FoxO and rotund form a binding complex governing wing polyphenism in planthoppers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107182), **iScience** 2023 Sun-jie Chen ec tl **Yang Li**, Haijun Xu

#- Rotund is differentially expressed between long-winged and short-winged BPHs.
#- Knockdown of rotund reverses long wings into intermediate wings.
#- Binding to the TF FoxO inhibits the rotund activity.

#[How has HGT shaped the evolution of insect genomes?](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16311), **Environ Microbiol** 2023 Chao Liu **Yang Li**ec tl  Xing-Xing Shen

#- Insects are incredibly diverse and essential to ecosystems.
#- Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is important in prokaryotic evolution, and recent studies show it also plays a role in insect evolution.
#- Although genomic data has revealed many HGT events in insects, the full extent of its influence and the mechanisms behind it remain unclear.

#[HGT is widespread in insects and contributes to male courtship in lepidopterans](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16311), **Cell** 2022 **Yang Li** ec tl Xing-Xing Shen

#- Genome-scale screening of HGT in 218 insect genomes.
#- Intron gains from native insect genomes were likely involved in HGT adaptation.
#- Lepidopterans acquired, on average, the highest number of HGT-acquired genes.
#- HGT-acquired gene enhances male courtship behavior in lepidopterans.
